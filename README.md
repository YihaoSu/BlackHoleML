Machine Learning Classification of Black Hole X-ray Light Curves
================================================================

This project aims to provide a full classification of the X-ray light curves of 
black hole X-ray binaries, here specifically the source GRS 1915+105, using 
supervised machine learning. 

The repository is laid out as follows: 
* code: python scripts and helper functions used in the analysis
* data: some useful data files, with additional data uploaded [INSERT LINK]
* notebooks: Jupyter notebooks detailing the analysis and allowing for reproducting of the figures in the paper
* paper: all files related to the manuscript submitted to MNRAS
